Simple Form aims to be as flexible as possible while helping you with powerful components to create your forms. The basic goal of Simple Form is to not touch your way of defining the layout, letting you find the better design for your eyes. Most of the DSL was inherited from Formtastic, which we are thankful for and should make you feel right at home.
